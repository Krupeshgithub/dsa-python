# stack

A stack is a linear data structure that keeps elements in LIFO(Last in first out) manner. It means that elements last added will be popped from the stack first.

In the python there are four way of implementing a stack. Using a list, collection.deque, queue.LifoQueue, linked list.

# The functions associated with stack:

1. empty() - Returns whether the stack is empty - Time Complexity: O(1)
2. size() - Returns the size of the stack - Timt Complexity: O(1)
3. top()/peek() - Returns a reference to the topmost element of the stack- Time Complexity: O(1)
4. push(a) - Inserts the element 'a' at the top of the stack - Time Complexity: O(1)
5. pop() - Deletes the topmost element of the stack - Time Complexity: O(1)

# Prerequisites

1. Python
2. Basic knowlage of list in python.
